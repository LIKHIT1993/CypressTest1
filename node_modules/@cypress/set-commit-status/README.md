# @cypress/set-commit-status
> Small utility for setting GitHub commit status based on GH app installation

This utility is meant to be used by GitHub App installations. Thus your environment should have the following 3 pieces of authentication information set as environment variables:

* `GH_APP_ID`
* `GH_INSTALLATION_ID`
* `GH_PRIVATE_KEY`

The `GH_PRIVATE_KEY` is the base64-encoded private key. For example, if you copy the contents of the private "pem" file into your clipboard, from the terminal you can execute "pbpaste | base64 | pbcopy" and get the encoded string in the clipboard.

## Debugging

Run with environment variable `DEBUG=@cypress/set-commit-status` to see more log messages
